Coursera Courses Projects

This course covered commonly used statistical inference methods for numerical and categorical data. I learned how to set up and perform hypothesis tests, interpret p-values, and report the results of analysis in a way that is interpretable for clients or the public. Using numerous data examples, I learned to report estimates of quantities in a way that expresses the uncertainty of the quantity of interest.
